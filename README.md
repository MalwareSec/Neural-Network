# Neural Network
## Pythonic Neural Network that learns from user inputs

This project originally started from:

https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1

It's an incredible introduction into neural networks and definitely worth the read.

I wanted to improve it by adding user input and having the synaptic weights adjust automatically based on the new preferences

Dependencies:
	numpy

	>_ pip install numpy

How to run:

	>_ python neural-network.py

Enter your new inputs and watch how the synaptic weights change based on the new inputs 

It's still in development but feel free to fork it and improve it at your own discretion.

Enjoy,
